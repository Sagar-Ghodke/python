#dynamically typed language
#no need to declare data types in program

# a=20
# marks=90.8
# result=True
# name="Sagar"

# print(type(a))
# print(type(marks))
# print(type(result))
# print(type(name))



# memory management 
# in case of fundMENTAL DATA types- pvm checks multiple memories with same values, and gives same reference to all variable
# checked by same address to memory location

# phy=50
# math=50
# chem=50 

# print(id(phy))
# print(id(math))
# print(id(chem))



# garbage- value change -> different address-> existing goes to garbage

# math=50
# print(id(math))
# math=40
# print(id(math))
